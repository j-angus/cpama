      C       is quirky,    flawed,         and   an
enormous    success.           Although accidents of          history
 surely  helped,     it evidently         satisifed  a          need

     for  a   system   implementation         language          efficient
enough    to   displace           assembly    language,
  yet sufficiently     abstract     and fluent      to descrirbe
 algorithms   and       interactions      in a      wide    variety
of   environments.
